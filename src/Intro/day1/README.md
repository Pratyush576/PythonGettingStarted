#Day 1

Python Syntax compared to other programming languages
* Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.
* Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics.
* Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.
* Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.

What can Python do?
* Python can be used on a server to create web applications.
* Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.
* Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.
* Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.
* Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.

Why Python?
* Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).
* Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.
* Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.
* Pthon runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.
* Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.

### Printing In Python
    print("<stuff to be printed>")

### Running the file
    python <filename.py>

### Check installed python version
    # Check pyhton version using terminal
    python --version

    # Check pyhon version of the editor using sys module
    import sys
    print(sys.version)
### Comments in pyhton
    # Single line comment 



    """
    Multiline comment
    """
### Variable Naming
    * A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume). Rules for Python variables:  
        * A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
        * A variable name cannot start with a number
        * A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
        * Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
        * A variable name cannot be any of the Python keywords.

    # Multiword variable naming techniques
        * Camel Case: 
            myVariableName = "John"
        * Pascal Case:
            MyVariableName = "John"
        * Snake Case
            my_variable_name = "John"
